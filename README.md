# zpl-exporter
a dirty, inefficient but working simple code to gather your beloved music files stock in the playlist of the "Groove Music" app (Windows 10 official music player) which is a ".zpl" file.

## Usage

  1. Download the code OR clone it into the repository OR just copy-paste it into your '.py' file on the desktop
  2. Run the script using CMD or another way you may know, it doesn't matter
  3. Give needed inputs to it
  4. enjoy the feeling of dirty and not exactly automated life.
